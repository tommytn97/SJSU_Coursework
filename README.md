# SJSU Coursework

Coursework done during my time in San Jose State University's Master of Science Bioinformatics Program

**<u>CS-286 - Prediction of subcellular locations with DNA sequences (Final)</u>**

[*Code found in CS286_Final*](https://github.com/tommytn97/SJSU_Coursework/blob/main/CS285_Final/TommyNguyen_CS286_final_submitted.ipynb)

Final involved either being individual or groupwork (this final was done individually). Final was scored based on attempt to predict subcellular locations with DNA sequences. The code used SVM linear classifier and decision tree classifier to predict subcellular locations and SVM linear classifier produced better accuracy, precision, and recall. 

**<u>CS-223 - Genetic Algorithm and Travelling Salesman Problem</u>**

[*Code found in CpG_Viterbi*](https://github.com/tommytn97/SJSU_Projects/blob/main/CpG_Viterbi/HidenMarkov.py)

Project involved customizing a genetic algorithm to solve the travelling salesman problem. Given a list of cities and its distances between pairs of cities, output a .txt file that shows the shortest pathway for the travelling salesman problem. 

**<u>CS-223 - Prediction of CpG-Islands using the Viterbi Algorithm</u>**

[*Code found in Traveling_Salesman_Genetic_Algorithm*](https://github.com/tommytn97/SJSU_Projects/blob/main/Traveling_Salesman_Genetic_Algorithm/TommyNguyen_GS_TS.py)

Instructor provided hidden Markov model parameters with integers as the format. The goal is to convert the integers using log~2~ values and implement the Viterbi algorithm to predict CpG-islands. 

**<u>CS-185 - Machine Learning to Predict Survival Rate of Patients with Heart Failure</u>**

[*Code found in ML_Heart_Failure*](https://github.com/tommytn97/SJSU_Projects/blob/main/ML_Heart_Failure/TommyNguyen_CS185_Project.ipynb)

This project was a introduction to machine learning. Pandas was used to tabulate the data and Seaborn for visuals. Scikit-learn was used to predict survival rate of patients. Presentation of project can be found here:
